## adjust DPSW threshold

noticed that DPSWs are close to 0, most between 0.1 and 0.2.

we decided to use 0.01:0.01:0.2 as the threshold and step, hoping to find the optimal DPSW.

| dataset | GE(mean) | cv(变异系数) | 归一化  |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ | ------- |
| HC      | 0.3690   | 0.1509       | 0.3508  |
| EMCI    | 0.3313   | 0.2360       | 1.0492  |
| LMCI    | 0.3132   | 0.2042       | 0.5261  |
| AD      | 0.3238   | 0.0978       | -1.2245 |

it seems the figure was plotted using GE(mean), not standardized ones.

However, the comparison between the figures is meaningless. We should aim to find relations between features, not between average values.
计算并归一化这些特征是无意义的，我们应该着重于寻找单个矩阵的不同特征之间的联系，而不是比较不同类型（症状）矩阵的总体区别。
