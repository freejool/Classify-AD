## tried to process the data as article[^indentifying2021]

pre-process needed before bct analysis, including Correlation (assumed done) and dPSW thresholding (using threshold_proportional) and diagonal elements set to 0.

PSW is defined as the number of the retained strong weights divided by the total number of weights.

as for each individual, different PSW value should be calculated by:

$$max_{PSW}(GCE)=E-PSW$$

E is a function of PSW. Technically Varying PSW from 0.01 to 1 step 0.05 to determine the optimal PSW. plots of gces are showed below:

some of the figures seem like quadratic functions and have one peak only, but there are 2 figures out of 17 that have 2 peaks which are not expected.

whatever, I continued calculating.[calcDPSW.m](code/calcDPSW.m)[calcGlobalEfficiency.m](code/calcGlobalEfficiency.m)

|dataset|global efficiency|

|HC|0.3690|
|LMCI|0.3132|
