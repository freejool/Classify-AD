# Week 11

TARGET:

- find implemention of BP and more ML techniques in python.
- calculate more characteristics of the brains.
- store them in a decent way.

## ML techniques

Found a repo of some ML techniques implemented in python including BP, SVM, K-Means, etc.

https://github.com/lawlite19/MachineLearning_Python

I tried BP. The accuracy is pretty low. Just a little bit better than guessing.![](img/iShot2022-05-04_23.27.01.png)

Thats what reminds me that "K_Means is not funtional in the project" is not true. Because the earlier demos are limited to 3 dimensions in which no ML method can perform corrcetly.

**The urgent need is acquire more characteristics but bot blame ML methods**

## More characteristics

### chars that have been calculated:

- assortativity
- charpath
- small_world_index
- mean clustering_coefficient

### Done this week

- clustering_coefficient (360 vector)
- maximized modularity: 将所有点分组，使得组内节点连接最大化，组间最小化。output: [Ci, Q]. Q is the maximized modularity.
- mean clustering coefficient: clustering coefficient 的平均值。
- sthength (360 vector)
- local efficiency (360 vector)
- betweenness centrality (360 vector)

## manage the data

1. store matlab varables in json. ![](img/iShot2022-05-04_23.38.51.png)
2. read the json files into mongoDB. ![](img/iShot2022-05-04_23.40.13.png)
3. combine characteristics into one csv file in Python.![](img/iShot2022-05-04_23.41.35.png)
4. perform ML methods on these csv files.

# One more thing

After calculating a little, I've got **1445** characteristics. input them to the BP network.

## BP network 4 classes

![](img/iShot2022-05-05_11.13.36.png)

## K-Means 2 classes

Note that raw data is not divided into training set and testing set (TODO). But the Correct Rate is still better than last week.
